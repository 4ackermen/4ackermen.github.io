## Final Report
### A Quick Recap

Pundit is a technical assessment platform for companies, organizations, and CTF teams to assess skills and recruit candidates in the security field.


## High level overview


For companies, Pundit is an all-in-one candidate monitoring solution. Recruiters can see everything - right from how well candidates are performing in solving the challenges via means like leaderboards and User Statistics to configuring individual task verification methods and providing test cases.

Pundit is designed to be an organization-specific, self hosted solution. This means that Pundit has no central servers, unlike, say, Hackerrank, where anyone can host a contest or participate in one. Pundit provides the skeleton - it fulfills all the fundamental needs an organization expects during its recruitment process, allowing any organization to pick it up, customise it for their own needs, and host it.

For instance, if tomorrow, Cisco decides to hire security candidates, Cisco has the responsibility of hosting and setting up a Pundit server. Cisco also has complete freedom of customising it to its own needs, which is not possible with centralised solutions like Hackerrank.

## Going deep

For candidates, the means by which they communicate with Pundit will be via a chat bot. We identifed Discord as the primary avenue for this chat bot.

### Discord?

Discord is a chat platform, like Slack.  
We chose Discord as the first avenue for Pundit’s frontend considering our target user base: security teams. 
Discord is the most popular place for security teams. The most closest example is Team bi0s who use Discord for everything from recruitment to daily communication. Also unlike Slack, Discord’s free plan has far less limitations and is much more “community” oriented with a friendlier outlook in its interface.

### Why not a website or an app?

To favour a dynamic atmosphere between recruiters and candidates. A website may be able to achieve the same functionality with chat platforms/forums, but we think Discord is the best place because for one, teams need not move from Discord and for two, we can focus on what really matters.
Candidates and recruiters are much more tightly bound in a Discord setting where exchange of data and decisions can take place at a lightning pace versus an entirely new platform and interface.

### How will it work? 

An organization can add “Pundit” as a ‘chat bot’ to their Discord channel where all candidates are present. Candidates can chat with the bot for everything they need to do with Pundit - from task submission to getting the leaderboard, by simply messaging the Discord bot with a particular set of commands that are available to the user. 

 An example user flow: if a user ABC decides to submit a task named “challenge1”, the steps he must follow are:
ABC messages the bot
- The bot will then reply with all of the commands that it accepts. Various commands like “show leaderboard”, “submit task”, “show submissions”, etc, are displayed by the bot. 
- ABC needs to submit a task, so ABC chooses the “submit task” command, so he types and sends the command to the bot.
- The bot identifies and then follows the flow for the submission. Starting with asking to send the solution file from ABC.
- ABC attaches the solution as a file and sends it to the bot.
- The bot accepts the solution and sends it to the Pundit server for verification and asks ABC to wait while verification is being done.
- After verification, the result is sent to ABC. If ABC successfully completes the challenge, the bot will increase ABC’s score in the leaderboard. Otherwise, it will ask ABC to submit again.

## Going Technical

### Block Diagram


We intend to use Python as our main development language. 

The external APIs that we will be using in this project will be Discord’s APIs. Since the ‘frontend’ is a Discord chat bot, all what we do in the backend will be communicated through the Discord API to control the Discord Bot.
